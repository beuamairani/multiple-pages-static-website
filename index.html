    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a delicious French pastry, known by its crescent shape.
      (Croissant means crescent in French). Puff pastry is used to make this
      delicacy - the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded a few
      times, then rolled into its shape. It is then glazed with butter and
      baked.
